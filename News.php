  			 	 		 <p>
Saturday November 29, 2014 marked another milestone in the Higher Institute of Business Management and Technology (HIBMAT), Buea, as the Higher Institute celebrated its 5th matriculation ceremony. New and old students with their parents, guardians and well-wishers enlivened the Checkpoint and Bokova road environs of Molyko, Buea, where

The Higher Institute’s campuses are located as they danced to music blaring out of huge speakers in celebration of the event. A trail blazer was the Holy Mass presided at by the Vicar General of Buea Diocese and Parish Priest of St. Charles Lwanga Parish Molyko, Rev. Fr. Bernard Asek. The guests and students twirled piously in solemnity as the HIBMAT choir rent the air with a repertoire of Catholic liturgical melodies. In his homily, Fr. Asek praised the administration of HIBMAT for recognizing God as the beginning and the end of every human venture despite the fact that HIBMAT is a private University Institution. “I am very excited to celebrate this Mass because I know that you fear God and that is why I could not afford to be absent from this Mass,” he said.  			 	 		 	
  			 	 		 </p>
  			 	 		 <p>
He said intellectual formation without God can only produce intellectual devils as he charged the new students to strive for holistic education. “Cultivate good morals, shun sexual immorality, dress modestly and focus on your studies,” stressed the Vica General.
  			 	 		 </p>
               <p>
The Director of HIBMAT, Mr. Jude Anyanwu, called on the new students to respect the rules and regulations of HIBMAT and noted that the higher Institute is founded on Christian principles and values.                 
               </p>
               <p>
He condemned academic fraud. “If anyone of you has presented fake GCE Certificates to gain admission here, know that it will not be long before you will be sorted out and the consequence will be automatic dismissal,” he cautioned.

Barely a month after matriculating over 600 students, the Higher Institute of Business Management and Technology (HIBMAT) Buea, attracted another mammoth crowd of friends and well-wishers on Saturday January 24, 2015 to witness the 5th convocation ceremony in the annals of the Higher Institute.
                        </p>
                        <p>
The event celebrated under the theme “Training professionals for an emerging Cameroon,” saw over 125 former students conferred with Higher Diplomas in Management, Marketing, Accountancy, Banking and Finance, Insurance, Tourism and Hospitality Management, Human Resource Management, Engineering and Technology in the presence of the Chief of Examination at the Ministry of Higher Education, Mrs. Tonye Ruth, among other visiting academicians, religious, civil and traditional authorities from far and near.
                        </p>
                        <p>
The ceremony began with a solemn Holy Mass presided at by the Director of John Paul II Institute of Theology, Buea, Rev. Fr. Herbert Niba. In his sermon, Fr. Niba reminded the graduating students that convocation is a commissioning and a public undertaking for one to go and transmit one’s professional training into public use towards the realization of the common good. Drawing inspiration from the Gospel of Mark, Fr. Niba urged the graduating students to be selfless in all they do and strive to please God and not humans.
                        </p>

               <p>
The Director of HIBMAT, Mr. Jude A., a Chartered Accountant by Profession, congratulated the graduates and urged them to make excellent use of the training they have received in HIBMAT. He told them to go to the job market without fear for they have been adequately equipped with professional skills to face any challenge. He exhorted them not to fall prey to the lure of money. “shun all forms of corrupt practices in all you do and God will bless you immensely,” he insisted.   
               </p>
               <p>
The Registrar of HIBMAT, Dr. Donatus N., urged the graduates to see the beauty and troubles of the world through wise, hopeful and compassionate eyes. He exhorted them not to do anything against the ethics of their profession as they get into the job market.                
               </p>
               <p>
Other speakers included the Assistant Divisional Officer for Buea Sub Division, Mrs. Ebot and a representative of the Director of the National Employment Fund, Mr Mvondo. This was immediately followed by award of prizes to the meritorious students both in cash and in kind.
